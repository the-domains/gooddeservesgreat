description: "The Baltimore Dance Crews Project set an ambitious goal Tuesday: By posting step-by-step video tutorials, the fledgling group hoped to get 5,000 people dancing and raise $5,000. Brian Gerardo, the group's director, said momentum from #GivingTuesday brought them dozens of new followers on Facebook and Instagram, and put them on track toward raising the cash they need to offer after-school programs and workshops to more local children and teens."
